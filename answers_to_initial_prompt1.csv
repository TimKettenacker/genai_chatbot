As of my last knowledge update in October 2021, "The Rings of Power" was a highly anticipated show set in J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-earth, but details about specific characters and plot developments were limited. Annatar, in Tolkien's legendarium, is a persona of Sauron who appeared in a beautiful form to deceive the Elves of Eregion into helping him craft the Rings of Power. If "The Rings of Power" includes Annatar in its second season, it likely refers to a character who plays a key role in the creation of the Rings and the deception of the Elves.

For the most accurate and up-to-date information on character developments in "The Rings of Power," including Annatar's role in the second season, I recommend checking the latest news sources, official announcements, or viewing the episodes directly.
